                            <h1>Three Essential Digital Marketing Channels In 2020.</h1>
                            <p>2020 has been a challenging year for marketing professionals and agencies would be an understatement. While some
                            companies and industries are affected more than that, every marketer needs to take a step back and reevaluate their
                            marketing strategies to adapt to a suddenly changed landscape.</p>
                            <p>Many companies have taken this opportunity to jump on to the newest platforms and marketing channels to engage with
                            their audiences in entirely new ways. There are certainly good reasons to test different and new communication channels,
                            but when you reassess your marketing ideas, don't ignore some of the more tried-and-true digital marketing strategies
                            that already have a track record of success.</p>

                            <ul class="list">
                                <li>- EMAIL</li>
                                <p>When it comes to digital marketing, email is the core of the industry. But, like wine or whiskey, email marketing keeps
                                getting better with Era. Today, email can adapt to accommodate the device when a recipient uses to access their Mail,
                                from a smartphone with a touchscreen to a desktop with a mouse and everything. Messages can focus on text or become as
                                interactive as a website.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If you havent already using email marketing, this is the perfect time for you to start incorporating it into your
                            marketing Plan. If email Marketing is already a part of your strategy, this is a good time to re-evaluate how you're
                            using the Platform and look for more opportunities to incorporate it and drive better results. we're seeing an increase
                            in overall email marketing activity across world in many industries. With so many more people working from home, at
                            least temporarily, email can be even more effective at driving results.
                            
                            </p>
                                <li>- SMM</li>
                                <p>Similar to email, SMM (Social Media Marketing) marketing isn't exactly the new kid on the block. It has been a daily
                                life for most consumers since they bought their first cell phone. While we think of SMM as a way to send out your Brand
                                Identity and Build your Brand Using Social Media Platforms.
                            <br><br>
                            However, SMM marketing can be challenging, and like email, requires strict compliance with a set of regulations. The
                            channel itself is also more restrictive than most marketing channels,.
                        
                        </p>
                                <li>- VIDEO</li>
                                <p>Ever since the first motion picture, people have loved watching video content. With the advent of 4G, LTE and now 5G in
                                mobile, and high-speed broadband running into so many homes and businesses, delivering video content suddenly became a
                                fast and simple process. With that easy access came an explosion of video content for consumers to download or stream on
                                whatever device they have at hand. Today, video marketing is a booming communication channel, with companies creating
                                all kinds of content for their customers and prospects.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While the best quality video still requires higher-end equipment, it is now possible for virtually anyone to record
                                comparatively good quality video on the smartphone in their pockets. This has given marketers the ability to get very
                                creative with video content, without a significant financial investment. It's a far cry from the days where only bigger
                                brands might be able to afford to shoot and leverage TV with commercials.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Video is also incredibly versatile when it comes to developing creative content. In 2020, with social distancing and
                                work-from-home becoming the norm, video can provide a way to deliver more personal messages, while face-to-face
                                interactions are limited. Whether that is recording videos of your company's team members in their home offices or
                                leveraging user-generated content around product reviews, video can help bridge the gap and make a more personal
                                connection with your audience. Once you have video content, it is easy to incorporate it into your other marketing
                                channels, like email and social, expanding its impact.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There are many other marketing channels you should employ in your overall marketing strategy, but make sure you consider
                                each of these as you continue to adjust your overall marketing plan for the remainder of this year and beyond.
